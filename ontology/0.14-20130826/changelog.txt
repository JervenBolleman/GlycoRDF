1) has_name 
Domain:monosaccharide => monosaccharide or compound 

2) has_strain 
Domain => Taxon 

3) used_buffer 
Domain:evidence_nmr => evidence_nmr or reaction 


4) has_substrate is new object property.
Object is consumed by the reaction.
Domain:reaction
Range:saccharide or glycoconjugate

5) has_product is new object propety.
Object is generated by the reaction.
Domain:reaction
Range:saccharide or glycoconjugate


6) catalyzed_by moved to Object Property.
Then, generated_by and degrated_by are subclass of catalyzed_by.

+catalyzed_by
++generated_by
++degrated_by

catalyzed_by
domain:saccharide or glycoconjugate
range:anyURI => reaction


7) Removed saccharide class at domain of has_aglycon.
has_aglycon
Domain:glycoconjugate or saccharide => glycoconjugate


8) Added evidence class at domain of published_in.
published_in
Domain:referenced_compound => referenced_compound or evidence

9) glycan_binder moved to subclass of compound.
+compound
++glycan_binder


10) Added enzyme class under the compound class.
+compound
++enzyme

11) Added has_enzyme.
has_enzyme
Object is an enzyme, which performs the reaction.
domain:reaction
range:enzyme


12) Added new data property and it is subproperty of has_repeat count.
+has_repeat_count 
++has_repeat_count_max
++has_repeat_count_min


13) Add new object property that is hybrid_with.

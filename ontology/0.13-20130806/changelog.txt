Questions:
- Do we have a rule how to discriminate between glycopeptide and glycoprotein? And is this descrimination necessary at all? In my opinion it is rather arbitrary, regardless where you define the border between a peptide and a protein.
- Do we need references (seeAlso  etc for lectin and antibodys).
- http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name vs has_name
- use of protein uris instead of own URI
